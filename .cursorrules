# Agent Behavior & Rules (Scraper Repo)

## Documentation
- **ALWAYS** update `DEV_LOG.md` at the end of a session if you made significant changes.
  
## Terminal & Shell (PowerShell)
- **DO NOT use `&&`** chaining in Windows PowerShell commands. Use `;` instead.
- **DO NOT** assume `ls` works like Linux/Mac `ls` (it is an alias for `Get-ChildItem`).
  
## Code Quality
- Logging: Always use `logger.info()` or `logger.error()`, never `print()` for production scripts.
- Use Spanish for comments.
